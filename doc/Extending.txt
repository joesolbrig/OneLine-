Oneline has a plugin architecture similar to Launchy or Quick Silver (actually taken and modified from Launchy). 

However, the easiest way to extend Oneline is through ini-based scripts. 
By the time of official release, the script format should be stable and allow you to 
compactly specify the unique character of a given API, allowing datasources to be created
and tuned quickly. 
Eventually, a user would be able to download such source file when they 
existing websites or any source that they are accessing. 

See files in ./script/specification for details.
