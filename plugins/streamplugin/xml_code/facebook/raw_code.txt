These queries can only be executed by an application with certain extended permissions, and the Test Console does not have any. To perform these queries on your own, you need to have a Facebook application you administer. You can then enable the needed permissions using the following two URIs, replacing "ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff" with the application's API key:

    * http://www.facebook.com/authorize.php?api_key=ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff&v=1.0&ext_perm=read_mailbox
    * http://www.facebook.com/authorize.php?api_key=ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff&v=1.0&ext_perm=read_stream
