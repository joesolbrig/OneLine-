&lt;p&gt;This is the article on Freud published on the ICC website. As the introduction points out, this is a contribution to debate and not a positional document of the ICC. All considered comments welcome. In this case, it may be useful to say that I am the author of the article. &lt;/p&gt;

Firstly, going on about how you&amp;#039;re opposed to &amp;quot;democracy&amp;quot; will make you sound like some kind of totalitarian vanguardist to the uninitiated - but that&amp;#039;s really an issue of how you present yourself to the outside world, not a problem with the critiques of democracy. &lt;/p&gt;

I seem to remember a quote, I think by Gorter or someone like that, which goes something like, &amp;quot;in the last analysis, every political party, every soviet, every union, is a party for or against the revolution&amp;quot;.  I can&amp;#039;t find it using Google.  Can anyone help?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks. &lt;/p&gt;

If, based on the council models, socially owned enterprises exist at a local level, does this mean businesses won&amp;#039;t be able to set up branches in other parts of the country, much less at an international scale? How would trade between other businesses and countries be conducted? &lt;/p&gt;

The other day I was reflecting on one of the ICC raids of 1981. It was the second raid on my flat. From the top window, through the curtains, I saw three cars arrive and carefully park in front of the building. It was a dark, cold early evening. The lights in the flat had been turned off. Kl and I were in. Waiting. We knew they would return. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate the term negative and positive and are obviously set up to give people negative connotations with negative freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positive freedom: Interferance in someones life for their own good/wellbeing e.g the smoking ban &lt;/p&gt;
