Desired plugins:
	
	Processes
	    Show information about processes a-la process manager
	    Actions taken akin to task manager... 
	    Lights would show heavy task activity
	
	Peer-to-peer chat protocol - 
	    Verification:
		Verification is entirely seperate from routing, 
		Verify with signature connected to your name+guid
		    Contacts provisionally or definitely verify folks
		    on their network and keep track of the verifications
		    of others...
	    Multiple routing system
		IP-IP connections as primary... (but you might be travelling so...)
		    Fall-back to a "location server"
			direct dns
			Web site which can server your location
	    When you connect:
		- Either you're at your static IP, so you don't to do anything (though a refresh might be useful)
		- You go to whatever server type you're logged onto...
		- 
	    Hopefully, someone else has already worked all this out and use their stuff
